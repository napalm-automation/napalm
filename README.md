NAPALM
======
NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support) is a Python library that implements a set of functions to interact with different router vendor devices using a unified API.

![NAPALM logo](static/logo.png?raw=true "NAPALM logo")

NAPALM supports several methods to connect to the devices, to manipulate configurations or to retrieve data.

Supported Network Operating Systems
-----------------------------------

Please check the following [link](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html) to see which devices are supported. Make sure you understand the [caveats](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#caveats).

Documentation
=============

Before using the library, please read the documentation at: [Read the Docs](https://napalm.readthedocs.io)

You can also watch a [live demo](https://youtu.be/93q-dHC0u0I) of NAPALM to see what it is and what it can do for you.

Install
=======

Full installation
-----------------

If you want to fully install NAPALM you can do it by executing:

```
pip install napalm
```

That will install all the drivers currently available.


Partial Installation
--------------------

If you want to install just a subset of the available modules you can just pick them as follows:

```
pip install napalm-eos napalm-junos
```

That will install only the `eos` and the `junos` drivers. If you want to remove or add a module later on you can just use `pip` to do it:

```
pip uninstall napalm-junos
pip install napalm-ios
```

Check the ['Supported Network Operating Systems'](#supported-network-operating-systems) section for more information about supported modules.

Upgrading
=========

We plan to upgrade napalm as fast as possible. Adding new methods and bugfixes. To upgrade napalm it's a simple as repeating the steps you performed while installing but adding the `-U` flag. For example:

```
pip install napalm -U
```

or:

```
pip install napalm-eos napalm-junos -U
```

We will be posting news on our slack channel and on Twitter (more details soon).

Automation Frameworks
======================

Due to its flexibility, NAPALM can be integrated in widely used automation frameworks.

Ansible
-------

Please check [napalm-ansible](https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-ansible) for existing Ansible modules leveraging the NAPALM API. Make sure you read the documentation and you understand how it works before trying to use it.

Salt
----

NAPALM will be completely integrated in [Salt](https://saltstack.com/) beginning with the release code named `Carbon`. For usage examples, please check [naplam-salt](https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-salt).


Contact
=======

Mailing List
------------

If you have any questions, join the users' mailing list at [napalm-automation@googlegroups.com](mailto:napalm-automation@googlegroups.com) and if you are developer and want to contribute to NAPALM feel free to join to the developers' mailing list at [napalm-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:napalm-dev@googlegroups.com)

Slack
-----

Slack is probably the easiest way to get help with NAPALM. You can find us in the channel `napalm` on the [network.toCode()](https://networktocode.herokuapp.com/) team.

FAQ
---

If you have any issues using NAPALM or encounter any errors, before submitting any questions (directly by email or on Slack), please go through the following checklist:

- Double or triple check if you indeed are able to access the device using the credentials provided.
- Does your device meet the minimum [requrirements](http://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#general-support-matrix)?
- Some operating systems have some specific [constraints](http://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#caveats). (e.g. have you enabled the XML agent on IOS-XR, or the NXAPI feature on NXOS?)
- Are you able to connect to the device using NAPALM? Check using the CLI test tool:

```bash
$ cl_napalm_test --vendor VENDOR --user USERNAME --password PASSWORD --optional_args OPTIONAL_ARGS HOSTNAME
```

Where vendor, username, password and hostname are mandatory. [Optional arguments](http://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#optional-arguments) are specified as comma separated values.

Example:

```bash
$ cl_napalm_test --vendor junos --user napalm --password dbejmujz --optional_args 'port=12202, config_lock=False' edge01.bjm01
```

In case you have any errors, please review the steps above - this looks like a problem with your environment setup.

In order to get help faster, when submitting a bug/error make sure to include all the details requested.

This project was founded by David Barroso as part of [Spotify][spotify] and Elisa Jasinska as part of [BigWave IT][bigwave]. Originally it was hosted by the [Spotify][spotify] organization but due to the many contributions received by third parties we agreed creating a dedicated organization for NAPALM and give a big thanks to [Spotify][spotify] for the support.
