Wrapping up
===========

You've now tried the main pieces of NAPALM:

* using NAPALM to get, set, and diff the configuration of a device manually
* driving NAPALM using Python

Shutting down
-------------

Shut down the Vagrant virtual boxes.  You can recreate them later using ``vagrant up`` if needed.

    $ vagrant destroy -f


Next Steps
----------

There are many possible steps you could take next:

* create Vagrant boxes for other devices
* explore using configuration management tools (Ansible, Chef, Salt, etc.)

Thanks for trying NAPALM!  Please contribute to this documentation and help grow the NAPALM community!
