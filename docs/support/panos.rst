PANOS
-----


Prerequisites
_____________

PANOS has a Python interface called `pan-python`. Anyway, for some feature like sending multiple commands, `Netmiko` would be a best choice.
That's why having Netmiko installed in your working box is a prerequisite.

netmiko >= 0.5.0


Replacing Configuration
________________________

Only configuration files are supported with `load_replace_candidate`. It must be a full XML file.
Due to the OS nature, at this time we don't support a replace using a configuration string.


Merging Configuration
________________________

Only configuration strings/lists are supported with `load_merge_candidate`. It can be a string or a list of strings in set-format.
Due to the OS nature and the NAPALM structure, at this time we don't support a merge using a configuration file because it'd need additional parameters. This may be supported in the future.


Atomic Changes
______________

Changes are atomic only when performing a configuration replace, since it's done with a single command.
