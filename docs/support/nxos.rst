Notes on configuration replacement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Config files aren't aren't normal config files but special "checkpoint" files.
That's because on NXOS the only way to replace a config without reboot is to rollback to a checkpoint (which could be a file).
These files explicitly list a lot of normally implicit config lines, some of them starting with ``!#``.
The ``!#`` part isn't necessary for the rollback to work, but leaving these lines out can cause erratic behavior.
See the "Known gotchas" section below.

Prerequisites
_____________

Your device must be running NXOS 6.1. The features ``nxapi`` server ``scp-server`` must be enabled.
On the device and any checkpoint file you push, you must have the lines::

  feature scp-server
  feature nxapi


Getting a base checkpoint file
______________________________

An example of a checkpoint file can be seen in ``test/unit/nxos/new_good.conf``.
You can get a checkpoint file representing your device's current config by running the ``get_checkpoint_file()``
function in the ``napalm.nxos`` driver.

Known gotchas
_____________

- Leaving out a ``shutdown`` or ``no shutdown`` line will cause the switch to toggle the up/down state of an interface, depending on it's current state.

- ``!#switchport trunk allowed vlan 1-4094`` is required even if the switchport is in ``switchport mode access``. However if ``!#switchport trunk allowed vlan 1-4094`` is included with ``no switchport``, the configuration replacement will fail.

- Vlans are listed vertically. For example ``vlan 1, 10, 20, 30`` will fail. To succeed, you need:
  ::

      vlan 1
      vlan 10
      vlan 20
      vlan 30

Diffs
_____

Diffs for config replacement are a list of commands that would be needed to take the device from it's current state
to the desired config state. See ``test/unit/nxos/new_good.diff`` as an example.

Notes on configuration merging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Merges are currently implemented by simply applying the the merge config line by line.
This doesn't use the checkpoint/rollback functionality.
As a result, merges are **not atomic**.

Diffs
_____

Diffs for merges are simply the lines in the merge candidate config.
